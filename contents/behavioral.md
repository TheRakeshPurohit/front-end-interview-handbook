Behavioral interview rounds focus on a candidate's soft skills - how they work with others, how they handled situations in the past where they have demonstrated collaboration, communication, conflict resolution, and mentoring skills.

Behavioral interviews are often overlooked and underestimated but I've seen candidates get rejected for failing the behavioral round even though they did very well on the coding and system design interviews. Clearing the behavioral interviews is especially important for candidates targeting senior level and above.

For comprehensive behavioral interview content, [Tech Interview Handbook](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/behavioral-interview/) covers that along with common behavioral interview questions from the top companies.

## What Meta looks for in behavioral interviews

- Provide specific examples about what you did and the resulting impact
- Critique yourself and share what you learned from a past situation
- Talk about what you like about your current role and/or being a developer
- Discuss why you'd like to make a change
